# TailStream for node.js

Continuously read from a growing file until stopped.

This is similar to other modules, however it requires an explicit `done()` signal before it stops checking and finally ends.

## Usage

Simply replace the `fs.createReadStream()` call with `tailstream.createReadStream()`:

    var tailstream = require('tailstream');
    var r = tailstream.createReadStream(â€¦);

Now consume it as a stand file `Readable` however you desire. Once you no longer have any interest in the file, call `done()` on it. This will trigger a final check before ending.

## Install

    npm install tailstream
